#+TITLE: blorgit (blog powered by org-mode and git)

* design

Thinking of using [[http://github.com/bmizerany/sinatra/tree/master][sinatra]] for the framework, [[http://github.com/eschulte/active_file/tree/master][active_file]] for object
persistence, and [[http://github.com/eschulte/acts_as_org/tree/master][acts_as_org]] for the org-mode exportation/interaction.

The overriding goal will be simplicity.

* notes
** sinatra
Sinatra is a very nice little mini-framework or DSL for writing simple
single-file web applications.
